# Federated-Learning-with-ResNet-50-on-CIFAR-10

With this study we want to deepen the scenario of
federated learning, implementing the best-known algorithms and
investigating the problems concerning the statistical heterogene-
ity, systems heterogeneity and privacy. As CNN model we used the
ResNet50 on the CIFAR-10 dataset. After a standard Federated
scenario, we implement different algorithms: FedAVG, FedGKT,
FedProx. Each one of the algorithms was tested with Batch and
Group Normalization and compare the results with considering
the IID and balanced version of CIFAR-10 and also the non-IID
and unbalanced version.
