    "### Abstract:\n",
    "A central tenet of Federated learning (FL), which trains models without centralizing user data, is privacy. However, previous work has shown that the gradient updates used in FL can leak user information. While the most industrial uses of FL are for text applications (e.g. keystroke prediction), nearly all attacks on FL privacy have focused on simple image classifiers. We propose a novel attack that reveals private user text by deploying malicious parameter vectors, and which succeeds even with mini-batches, multiple users, and long sequences. Unlike previous attacks on FL, the attack exploits characteristics of both the Transformer architecture and the token embedding, separately extracting tokens and positional embeddings to retrieve high-fidelity text. This work suggests that FL on text, which has historically been resistant to privacy attacks, is far more vulnerable than previously thought."

    "### Notes:\n",
    "* There are a variety of hyperparameters to the attack which are set to reasonable defaults. Performance of the attack could be improved in some unusual use cases (datasets or models) by tuning these parameters further.\n",
    "* In this example, dropout is disabled under the assumption that this is a parameter that can be controlled in the server update. The optimal attack simply disables dropout. However, the attack can still succeed when dropout is enforced by the user, albeit with a minor loss in reconstruction quality.\n",
    "* This example also assumes complete freedom to choose the parameter vector, for this reason we circumvent the smooth part of the GELU activation with a \"very\" large measurement vector magnitude. This is arguably excessive for only a small gain in accuracy. A similar argument can be made for the default softmax skew value.\n",
    "* We also want to re-emphasize that the design space of these parameter modification attacks is large. A defense against the specific parameter modification described here is unlikely to be safe in general!\n",
    "* Token recovery is much easier when the embedding is randomly initialized. Here we explicitely re-initialize the BERT embedding to improve label accuracy.\n",
    "* The embedding gradient is not strictly necessary for the attack. The attack can also be run with `token_strategy=None`, in which case the embedding gradient is entirely disregarded (and does not have to be learnable).\n",
    "* In our setup it made the most sense to consider the `[MASK]` tokens as part of the input (and this is also how the metrics are scored). However, the contents of the masked values are actually also leaked and are retrievable from the gradient of the decoder bias."
